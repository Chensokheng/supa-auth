# Installation

```sh copy
npx supaauth@latest init
```

1. The command will initialize `shadcn` for you, as our components are built on top of shadcn.
2. It will install the `supabase` package, create the supabase browser and server clients, and set up the supabase .env file for you.

## Skip shadcn

If you have installed shadcn-ui, you can skip by running this

```sh copy
npx supaauth@latest init --skip shadcn
```

## Update your .env

Add the following lines to your .env file, replacing the placeholders with your Supabase project details:

```sh copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_project_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
SUPABAE_ADMIN=
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_DOMAIN=
```

`SUPABAE_ADMIN` is service role secret inside your supabase project. This key has the ability to bypass Row Level Security. Never share it publicly.

`RESEND_API_KEY` && `RESEND_DOMAIN` is needed to use Resend to sending email to user. You can checkout more here: https://resend.com/home . Checkout this tutorial for more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEeksraKfJI&t=4s
